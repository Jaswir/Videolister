<b>Setup</b>

	1. Download and unzip this Github file, this will create a map named Videolister-master
	2. Download and install the LTS version of node.js via https://nodejs.org/en/
	3. Start Command Prompt and type "cd" followed by the path to Videolister, 
	   e.g. "cd Downloads/Videolister-master/Videolister-master"
	4. Enter "npm start"
	5. After a short moment, your webbrowser will automatically open http://localhost:3000/
	6. Enter a Youtube playlist URL in the box and press "Submit", 
	   e.g. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMC9KNkIncKtPzgY-5rmhvj7fax8fdxoj


<b>Troubleshooting</b>

	1. Make sure you use the URL of the playlist itself, not from a video playing in a playlist
	2. This will not work with the Watch Later playlist, as it does not store this information in the URL
